                Our ATM transaction management system ensures that all actions
                in a single money transfer are completed without error. If some
                of the tasks are completed but an unexpected issue occurs during
                the money withdrawal, our ATM parameters help restore the
                recorded transactions from before the failed exchange was
                handled. If all exchange actions are completed successfully, the
                exchange is completed by our ATM exchange preparation framework,
                and the money is paid to the client.
